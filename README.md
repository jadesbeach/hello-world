# hello-world
my first repository!
My name is Jade! I'm a beginner programmer with one daughter and I stay at home teaching myself something new every day! I hope to grow in my skills and one day potentially have a career in tech! I'm also in the process of applying to colleges for my Bachelor's in Computer Science! I'd love to know more about you and connect personally and professionally!
